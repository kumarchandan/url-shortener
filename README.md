# User Story
    - I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
    - If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
    - When I visit that shortened URL it will redirect me to the original link.
